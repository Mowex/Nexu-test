## 👨‍💻 Personal Comment
Project created with the goal of obtaining a full-stack developer position at Nexu!!

Completing this test in two hours was a real challenge because, despite knowing the technology, there are always small errors that come up and need to be dealt with, which takes time... The initial setup took more time than I would have liked, which I believe is normal since, as a developer, you don't start projects every day. Sometimes you need to review documentation and other sources to find the best option when starting something new... Obviously, I took more than two hours to complete the project, but I didn't want to submit something incomplete, so I preferred to finish it... you have the final say... thank you very much for considering me!
