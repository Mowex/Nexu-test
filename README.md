# üöÄ FastAPI Project Initialization (Dockerized)

This project uses **Python 3.10.6** and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to build a fast and robust API. It is fully containerized using **Docker** for easier deployment.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory. Then, run the following command to build and start the application:

`docker-compose up --build`

This will start the FastAPI application, and it will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You can visit the interactive API documentation at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) or the alternative documentation at [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc).

If you make changes to the source code and want them to reflect in the running app, stop the container with `CTRL+C` and re-run the command:

`docker-compose up --build`

To stop and remove the container, use:

`docker-compose down`

## üß™ Running Tests (Optional)

If you'd like to run the tests outside of Docker, create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`, activate it (`.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux), install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run the tests using `pytest`.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Personal Comment

Project created with the goal of obtaining a full-stack developer position at **Nexu**! Completing this test in two hours was a real challenge because, despite knowing the technology, there are always small errors that need to be resolved ‚Äî and that takes time. The initial setup took more time than expected (normal, I think, since we don‚Äôt bootstrap new projects every day). I obviously took more than two hours to complete the project, but I preferred submitting something finished rather than incomplete. You have the final say‚Ä¶ **Thanks a lot for considering me!**
